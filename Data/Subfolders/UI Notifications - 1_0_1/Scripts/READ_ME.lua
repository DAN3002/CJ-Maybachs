Well hello there.

So as usual, my documentation is on the web here:

https://popthosepringles.github.io/Core-UI-Notifications-Docs/

If you just want to get right into it to try the examples, then do the following:

	1.  Drop the "UI Notifications" template into your hierarchy.
	2.  Drop the "UI Notifications - Examples" into your hierarchy.

That's it.  Enjoy :D
